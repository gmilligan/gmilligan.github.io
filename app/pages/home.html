        <h2>Greg Milligan</h2>
        <p>
          I have built and deployed software for 20+ years.
          A strong background in fullstack development, gives me practical perspective towards realworld software deployment.
          Extensive experience with manual deployment has taught me the value of automating infrastructure, builds, testing and deployment.

        <h2>Technologies</h2>
        <p>
        I am open to all modern DevOps tools. Given a greenfield project and discretion
        over which technologies could be employed, my choices would include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Infrastructure Automation: Terraform</li>
          <li>Configuration Management: Ansible</li>
          <li>Source Mangement: Git</li>
          <li>Continuous Integration: Jenkins</li>
          <li>Monitoring: Cloudwatch, CloudTrail or Nagios</li>
          <li>Collaboration: JIRA</li>
          <li>Containers: Docker, Swarm or Kubernetes (for larger requirements)</li>
          <li>Image Repositories: DockerHub, Docker Registry or ECR</li>
          <li>Messsage Brokering: RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ or AWS SQS</li>
          <li>Languages: NodeJs, Python, Bash, Make</li>
          <li>Infrastructure: AWS (EC2, S3, ECR, ECS, RDS, Route53, API Gateway, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Given a brownfield project: I learn existing systems and those targeted for improvement.
          I remain flexible to legacy or preferred technologies and provide
          suggestions where improvements might be realized.
        </p>

        <h2>Environments</h2>
        <p>
          Over the last 10 years, my development/deployment experience has been in LAMP, MEAN and MERN stacks.
          However, I have automated deployments for other environments, including Java and Python.
          Initially I worked in the Windows enviroment, writing and deploying compiled applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Much of automation is the same across environments.
          Actual build & testing becomes specialized for given environments.
        </p>

        <h3>Are containers the only way to go?</h3>
        <p>
            For my own business requirements, I containerize any process I can.
            However, I also understand containers do not fit every requirement.
            I still endevour to use them when ever possible or reasonable.
        </p>

        <h2>
            My Photography
        </h2>
        <p>
            Why would I include my photography as a part of my development shingle?
            Good photography is about seeing beauty in layout and composition.
            Perhaps my images will lend perspective towards my views.
            Either way, I get to show off my pictures.
