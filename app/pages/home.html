        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>
            I am a software developer and I have been for 20+ years.
            I love tech and coding.
            For the past few years, I have had the good fortune of building lots of mobile apps.
            Like most of you, my tablet/phone have become integral parts of my daily life.
            I would even say, I feel a little exposed without them.
            Writing mobile apps is a natural extension of this personal involvement.
            Also, embracing the "mobile first" mindset, I find apps written for mobile play equally on the desktop.

            Currently, MEAN is my stack of choice (i.e., Mongodb, Express, Angular &amp; Node).
            With a little help from Bootstrap, it is easy to write attractive, efficient and responsive apps.

            Life in Santa Cruz
        </h2>
        <p>
            I live in beautiful Santa Cruz, California.
            It is a hop, skip and a jump from Silicon Valley, but it has beaches.

            The Photography
        </h2>
        <p>
            Why do I include my photography as a part of my development shingle?
            Good photography is about seeing layout and composition.
            Perhaps my images will lend a perspective towards my view of design and layout.

            Loving Life
        </h2>
        <p>
            I enjoy what I do.
            I look forward to speaking to you about your software requirements, so I might do it for you.
