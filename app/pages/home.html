        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>
            I am a developer.
            For the past few years, I have had the good fortune of building mobile apps.
            Personally, the tablet has become a important part in my day to day life and writing apps for it has been a natural extension of that.
            In the "mobile first" mindset, apps written for mobile also seem to work well in the desktop browser.

            Currently, the MEAN stack is my choice of tools (Mongodb, Express, Angular &amp; Node).
            With a little help from Bootstrap, I find it is easy to write efficient and responsive apps.

            Life in Santa Cruz
        </h2>
        <p>
            I live in beautiful Santa Cruz, California.
            It is only a hop, skip and jump from Silicon Valley, but has beaches.

            The Photography
        </h2>
        <p>
            Why include my photography as a part of my development shingle?
            Good photography is about having the eye for layout and composition.
            I hope my images lend perspective towards my view of the world.
            Modern photography and post-production is fairly technical, so it it also speaks to my abilities with PhotoShop.

            I enjoy what I do. I look forward to speaking to you about your software requirements, so I might do it for you.
