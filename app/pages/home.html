        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>
            I have been serious about developing excellent software for 20+ years.
            I have written lots of mobile & web apps and like that space.
            I have also coded software that has nothing to do with "apps" (actual software).
            Long story short, I am comfortable with frontend, backend or middleware development.

            <b>MERN</b> is my current stack of choice (i.e., Mongodb, Express, React &amp; Node).
            React embraces <b>ES6</b> and all its advantages.
            I was coding Object Oriented JavaScript, before it was popular (circa 1998).
            Now <b>Object Oriented</b> has made way for <b>Functional Programming</b>.
            Either way, I have always liked JavaScript, not simply because it is the flavor de jour.
            Throw in <b>Bootstrap</b> and <b>CSS3</b> via <b>Sass</b>, it becomes effortless to write attractive, efficient and responsive apps.

          DevOps - Light
        </h2>
        <p>
          While I consider myself a coder, I have always managed servers & software deployment, so <b>DevOps</b> becomes a given.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the course of software development I have maintained lots of servers.
          For a few years it was Windows servers, running IIS and SQL Server.
          Then Linux app servers running <b>Nginx</b>, <b>Apache</b>, with others running <b>MySQL</b>, <b>MongoDB</b> and/or <b>NeoJS</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, of course, it is <b>AWS</b> instances.
          I love the command line and <b>shell scripting</b>.
          Put it together with <b>Terraform</b>, <b>Puppet</b> and <b>Jenkins</b> and voila <b>DevOps</b> is the enevitable outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, I am a coder first.

            Life in Santa Cruz

        <p>
            I live in beautiful Santa Cruz, California.
            It is only a hop, skip and a jump from Silicon Valley, but has beaches.

        <h2>
            My Photography
        </h2>
        <p>
            Why include photography as a part of my development shingle?
            Good photography is about seeing beauty in layout and composition.
            Perhaps my images lend perspective towards my views of design and layout.
            Either way, I get to show off my pictures.

            I enjoy what I do.
            And, I look forward to speaking to you about your software requirements.
