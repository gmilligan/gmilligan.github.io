    <h2>Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      I am open to all modern DevOps tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given a greenfield project and tool discretion, my choices would include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Infrastructure Automation: Terraform</li>
      <li>Configuration Management: Ansible</li>
      <li>Source Mangement: Git</li>
      <li>Continuous Integration: Jenkins</li>
      <li>Monitoring: Cloudwatch, CloudTrail or Nagios</li>
      <li>Collaboration: JIRA</li>
      <li>Containers: Docker, Swarm or Kubernetes (for larger requirements)</li>
      <li>Image Repositories: DockerHub, Docker Registry or ECR</li>
      <li>Messsage Brokering: RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ or AWS SQS</li>
      <li>Languages: NodeJs, Python, Bash, Make</li>
      <li>Infrastructure: AWS (EC2, S3, ECR, ECS, RDS, Route53, API Gateway, etc)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Given a brownfield project: I learn existing systems and those targeted for improvement.
      I remain flexible to legacy or preferred technologies and provide
      suggestions where improvements might be realized.
    </p>

    <h2>Environments</h2>
    <p>
      Over the last 10 years, my development/deployment experience has been in LAMP, MEAN and MERN stacks.
      However, I have automated deployments for other environments, including Java and Python.
      Initially I worked in the Windows enviroment, writing and deploying compiled applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Much of automation is the same across environments.
      Actual build & testing becomes specialized for given environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Containers: the only way to go?</h2>
    <p>
      For my own business requirements, I containerize any process I can.
      However, I also understand containers do not fit every requirement.
      I still endevour to use them whenever possible or reasonable.
    </p>

    <h2>
      My Photography
    </h2>
    <p>
      Why in the world would I include my photography as a part of my development shingle?
      Good photography is about seeing beauty in layout and composition.
      Perhaps my images will lend a perspective towards my views.
      Either way, I get to show off my pictures.
